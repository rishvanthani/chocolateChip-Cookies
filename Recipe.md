Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch round pans.

Step 2
In a large mixing bowl, cream together butter and sugars. Beat in the eggs.

Step 3
In another bowl, sift together the flours, baking powder, and salt. Add this alternately with the milk to the creamed mixture. Stir in the vanilla. Chop the chocolate chips coarsely, and add to the batter.
